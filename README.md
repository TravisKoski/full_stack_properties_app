# full_stack_properties_app
Note: this is NOT for production use, but rather purely for my own curiosity, and learning purposes
This app simulates the interaction that a property manager has with multiple properties
As the user, you are able to view, create, and delete your property listings. You are also able to view the tenants for each property
How to use (only on localhost for now)
  make sure you have the most current version of ruby on rails, and npm installed
  Clone this repo
  Open two terminals, and run "npm start" on one, and "rails s" on the other.
  
Stay tuned! This app is a work in progress which I work on for my own enjoyment and learning.
